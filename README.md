This is my current configuration running on a Voron 2.4 350mm. 
The config is used with an EBB36 CANbus toolhead board via U2C to an Octopus Pro. 
I am running an AWD setup with 48V, TMC5160 Pros on my A/B drives. Feel free to use this config on your own printer remember to please update as neccessary.
